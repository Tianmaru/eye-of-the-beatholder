Eye of the Beatholder is a *One Button Rythm Roguelite*, heavily inspired by *Crypt of the Necrodancer*. Press the Spacebar on odd beats to move forward or attack enemies in front of you. Press the Spacebar on even beats to rotate your character to the right. The final boss is actually pretty tough, so make sure to collect some damage upgrades before fighting him.

**Thanks for playing and have fun!**
